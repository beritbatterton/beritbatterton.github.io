# Welcome!

Hi, I'm Berit Batterton, a PhD Candidate at the University of Texas at Austin Marine Science Institute.

I study how coastal salt marsh ecosystems respond to climate change, with a focus on vegetation dynamics and carbon cycling. My research combines long-term ecological monitoring, plant functional traits, and remote sensing to understand how drought, sea-level rise, and freshwater availability affect salt marsh plant communities and their capacity to sequester carbon. I investigate these dynamics across multiple spatial and temporal scales — from physiological trait variation within species to landscape-scale carbon stock modeling — primarily in estuarine marshes along the Texas coast. This work supports efforts to predict marsh responses to future climate scenarios and inform restoration and management strategies in vulnerable coastal systems.
