But I also enjoy stay-at-home activities such as reading, gardening and spinning wool into yarn."

    "text": "I find teaching and sharing my research with others immensely gratifying. In the past I have hosted R Coffee Hours and the corresponding ThinkR website as a way of helping students working with R statistical software. Further, as most research is publicly funded, to some degree I consider outreach and education a social responsibility. I enjoy having discussions about research and sharing or inspiring exciting and interesting ideas. I also enjoy hearing about new and interesting ideas or concerns about research. I have, therefore, deliberately sought opportunities to both improve my teaching skills and share the results of my research with interested parties.\nFor a list of teaching related activities see the Teaching section of my CV.\nFor a list of outreach related activities see the Outreach section of my CV."
